A page consists of at least one view (called a \"primary view\"), any number of additional views that can be docked along the edges (called \"docked views\"), and a partial URL associated with the page.\n- **Page Configuration:** A collection of settings that dictate how the page will behave during runtime, including which views are present on a page, as well as rules for docked views in the page.\n\nThus, Page Configurations are used to define pages that can be opened in the session, while Pages are running instances that are defined by the Page Configuration.

Each project can configure a Shared Settings that will be “inherited” by all pages in that project, allowing multiple pages to use the same docked views and corner priority settings.\n- **Initial Page URL:** Perspective assumes the initial page within a project will be located at page URL \"/\". When a session is launched, the session will start at the \"/\" page. It\u0027s recommended that the \"home\" or starting view for your project uses a page URL of just \"/\".",
